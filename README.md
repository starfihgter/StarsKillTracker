# StarsKillTracker
It tracks kills. How cool is that?

Give plugin permissions to players as a reward for reaching a certain number of kills on any type of mob! Perfect for skyblock, prison or even economy survival servers!
Fully customisable via. configuration files (generated after first server boot with Star's Kill Tracker installed).

Players can level-up after having killed certain quantities of mobs, granting plugin permissions (for shop plugins par example) as a reward for their time and effort.

Under config.yml, set a custom message prefix and alter the level-up messages displayed to the user.
Under levels.yml, add as many levels as one desires, the amout of kills required to progress each level, the mobs that count towards progressing that level and the permissions to grant once a player has completed that level!
